Slide 1

Good morning/afternoon everyone, today im going to present and speak about backend of side
of my sample project

Slide 2
So to make things more digestable, i have seperated the contents that we're going to discuss today
into 6 different sections, First we have introduction, to briefly introduce what the project is about
we have backend expectations, to explain what is expected of the backend, next we have the folder structure 
and folder breakdown, where we try to explain what each folder's purpose is for, and finally we have the backend flow
which simulates an API call to the backend server

Slide 3
So in this sample project, what we're aiming to build is a web and mobile application, that lets user
design email templates for them, this project will let users send personalized, unique and beautiful emails with ease.
In terms of the backend side, we are building this app with Node Express and we're also using MongoDB as the database
to store our user's templates.

Slide 4
Now lets talk about the backend side more, in terms of expectations it can be summarized as such,
for users they should be able to log in, check if the otp is correct or not, get, and update their user profile
for the templates, they should be able to be saved, to be retrieved, to be updated and to be sent as an email

Slide 5
Here are the API endpoints, since there's quite a bit im not going to out of my way to further explain these,
but if you're interested to know more, you can go to "{url}/v1/api-docs" which is the swagger endpoint to see more 
details

Slide 6
Folder structures, now on there are 3 folders that I would like to first explain, deploy, src, and script
deploy as it's name suggest is used for deploying the application, as well as any CI/CD related things,
script is for any script files in the case of this project, there is a script to generate a pair of public/private keys
and finally src is where the main codes of the program is located.

Slide 7
As you can see, there are a lot of subfolders in the src folder, in the next few slides, I will go through
each folder and explain to you what the purposes of each folder are
